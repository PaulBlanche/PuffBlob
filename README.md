# PuffBlob

PuffBlob is a personal cloud. Not a cloud, a puff. Not only it's yours, but you know where it is, and you control it. It's not a big cloud you can't reach.

## Concept

But PuffBlob is also a blob: It absorbs plenty of different things: Links, images, web pages, texts, music, videos, program snippets, articles, filesâ€¦ And that's a good thing because you have plenty of interesting thing you want to keep. Just throw them at your PuffBlob: It will absorb and keep them preciously. And it can grown large, as large as you want.

The good thing with a blob is that it can take different shapes. It can shape itself into a blog, displaying selected items stored in your blob. It can shape itself into a gallery, showing nice picture you have taken. It can shape itself into public bookmarks, showing interesting links you have found on the net. It can shape itself into a video gallery, showing the videos you have taken or found. It can shape itself in a MP3 player so that you can listen to your music.

You can create as many shapes as you want, each shape picking selectively different items from your blob and showing them in different manners.

Not really usable for now, but working on it.
